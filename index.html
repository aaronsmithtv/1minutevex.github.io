	<p>No matter what kind of Houdini tutorials you’ve searched or SideFX demonstrations you’ve seen, you’re likely to have come across the vast, incredibly powerful expression language that is VEX. It has quite the learning curve, as most languages do, but knowing how and when to use it efficiently can be amongst the most rewarding challenges in working with Houdini.

	<p>These tips are not intended for the Houdini or VEX beginner - they are an accumulation of the most useful snippets I have come across and written during the last few years. Having to trawl the internet for obscure code while under pressure to deliver can be very daunting; So I hope the following can be as convenient for you as they have been for myself.
