Overview
====================================================================================================

No matter what kind of Houdini tutorials you’ve searched or SideFX demonstrations you’ve seen, you’re likely to have come across the vast, incredibly powerful expression language that is VEX. It has quite the learning curve, as most languages do, but knowing how and when to use it efficiently can be amongst the most rewarding challenges in working with Houdini.

These tips are not intended for the Houdini or VEX beginner - they are an accumulation of the most useful snippets I have come across and written during the last few years. Having to trawl the internet for obscure code while under pressure to deliver can be very daunting; So I hope the following can be as convenient for you as they have been for myself.



U Attribute On Complex Curves
====================================================================================================

In this example, we use the 'surfacedist' function to find a point's distance from a target group. For our purposes, "end_pts" represents the group of points at the tip of our tree's branches.

By iterating surfacedist() over each point, we can build a range of distances to this target group, beginning at the furthest edge, and always ending at 0. We can then use a handy trick promoting these values as min/max to detail.

Finally, we use a second wrangle to fit the min/max distances to a 0-1 range; As the u attribute on a series of complex interconnected curves.

<div class='together'>
Let’s make some C++ code to output such a thing:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C
    // VEX surfacedist - Point Wrangle example

    int closest_pt;

    // Find the distance from point along edges to the target point group.
    f@surfdist = surfacedist(0, "end_pts", "P", @ptnum, closest_pt, "edge");

    // Store the min and max point edge distances as detail attributes.
    setdetailattrib(0, "surfdist_min", f@surfdist, "min");
    setdetailattrib(0, "surfdist_max", f@surfdist, "max");
